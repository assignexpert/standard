# standard

This is a collection of documents which describe how code is written and maintained in this organisation. Members of the organisation can challenge these guidlines. But it is expected to not deviate from these without sound reasoning.

- [CODE](./CODE.md) is a guide on code-style. 
- [GIT](./GIT.md) is a guide on operating git.

Other than this, we try our best to follow the [12 factor](https://12factor.net) principles.
